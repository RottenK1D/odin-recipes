    <h2>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 medium red peppers about 2 lbs</li>
        <li>1 lb potatoes</li>
        <li>2 onions finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 tablespoon olive oil or other vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder optional</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried savory (see notes)</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the tops of the peppers and clean the seeds. Peel the potatoes and chop them as finely as you can.</li>
        <li>In a frying pan or skillet heat the olive oil and cook the onion, until translucent. Add the potatoes and cook for 5-6 minutes until soft. It is ok if the potatoes start browning a bit, just stir frequently to avoid burning.</li>
        <li>Add paprika, garlic powder, black pepper, salt and any other spices you are using. Mix very well and remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Stuff the peppers with the cooked potatoes, pressing well to make sure there are no hollow parts.</li>
        <li>Arrange the peppers in a baking pan. If you have any leftover potatoes which didn’t fit in the peppers, spoon them around in the pan.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 20 minutes at 390°F/ 200°C or until the potatoes are completely soft and the peppers start getting brown on top.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
