    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Top off any get-together with a stunning tart made of a crisp puff pastry base, luscious yogurt, whipped cream, and roasted strawberries.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 c. apricot preserves</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. honey</li>
        <li>1 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Pinch of kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 lb. strawberries, halved, or quartered if large</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour, for rolling</li>
        <li>1 9-inch square puff pastry sheet (about 8 oz.), thawed</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 c. heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 c. whole-milk plain Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>3 tbsp. confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 350°F. Line 9- by 13-inch pan with parchment paper, leaving overhang on 2 long sides.</li>
        <li>In bowl, whisk together preserves, honey, vanilla, and salt. Add strawberries and toss to coat. Transfer to prepared baking pan and roast, stirring once, until strawberries are tender and juices start to reduce, but not brown, 40 to 50 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool.</li>
        <li>Increase oven temp to 400°F and line baking sheet with parchment.</li>
        <li>On lightly floured surface, roll out puff pastry to 10-inch square, then transfer to prepared baking sheet. Using sharp knife, gently score border about 3/4 inch from edges, then use fork to prick pastry inside borders.</li>
        <li>Brush border with beaten egg, then bake, rotating halfway through, until golden and puffed, 18 to 20 minutes. If pastry puffs up during baking, once it’s out of the oven (but while it’s still warm), top with second piece of parchment paper, then baking sheet to flatten. Let cool completely.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make filling: Using electric mixer on low speed, combine cream and yogurt, then increase to medium-high speed and beat to form soft peaks. Add confectioners’ sugar and vanilla and beat just to combine.</li>
        <li>Spread whipped yogurt mixture on top of baked puff pastry inside borders, then top with cooled roasted strawberries, spooning any juices over top. Serve any remaining berries on the side.</li>
    </ol>
